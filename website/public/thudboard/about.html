<h2>About Thud</h2>
<p>
<img class="pgf" src="img/rock.gif" alt="the Thud stone" width="36" height="36"/>
For the very first time there is a Board Game that is unique to 
DISCWORLD. THUD. A game of Strategy and Skill that combines the 
magic of DISCWORLD with an entirely unique approach to board game 
playing.
</p><p>
For more details about the game, and its creators, visit the Thud 
homepage at <a href="http://www.thudgame.com">http://www.thudgame.com</a>. 
You may also find some opponents to play on the forum there.

<h2>About ThudBoard</h2>
<p>
<img class="pgf" src="img/dwarf.gif" alt="a Dwarf" width="36" height="36"/>
ThudBoard is a computer application that can be used to play Thud
battles without using the actual board.
</p><p>
Its main purpose is to facilitate online gaming, where people 
communicate moves by sending each other board-coordinates. Using
the ThudBoard these moves can be carried out, and whole battles
can be saved either as a series of moves or as a board position.
</p><p>
Another feature is the fact that multiple battles can be stored, 
so you can play many games simultaneously without the onerous task
of remembering where each individual piece was in this battle you 
have been playing with your cousin in XXXX over the last few years.
</p>
<h2>About the rules</h2>
<p>
<img class="pgf" src="img/troll.gif" alt="a Troll" width="36" height="36"/>
The rules are copyrighted, and as such they are not included in 
this application. The rules can be found online at the offical 
Thud site <a href="http://game.thudguild.com/rules.html">rules page</a>.

Yeah, let's be brief about that :-)
I've been writing software for a number of years now, coding in C/C++,
PHP, HTML, SQL, whatever else I ran into. I've recently discovered 
Python and am very happy with it. This is one of the result of this
happiness.
</p><p>
You can send me bugreports, enhancement proposals, money, whatever.
I will usually react to this, although I cannot garantuee anything.

<h2>About the tools</h2>
<p>
<img class="pgf" src="img/rock.gif" alt="the Thud stone" width="36" height="36"/>
ThudBoard is written in Python using Tkinter for the user interface. 
Visit <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a> for 
more information on both.
</p>
<p>
ThudBoard is packaged as a standalone executable for 
Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> using the py2exe 
tool created by Thomas Heller and Mark Hammond. Take a look at the 
<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/">py2exe 
homepage</a>).<br/>
To make this package into a single-file executable installer 
Jordan Russell's Software package Inno Setup is used. More information
can be found at the <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">jrsoftware 
Inno Setup page</a>.<br/>
For the OS X standalone .app file I used the py2exe equivalent for the
Mac, named py2app, and created by Bob Ippolito. It is available from the
<a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/py2app">py2app page</a>.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All these tools are free software. Not only that: they are also very high 
quality tools that are easy to use. You don't have to trust me on this, 
as you can easily see for yourself.
